\title{Download and validate TD6401 ASOS 5-minute data}
\usage{
downloadTD6401(rmetObj, check = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{rmetObj}{An object of class \code{"rmet"} created by
\code{createMetProject()}.}

\item{check}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), existing files are
validated and only re-downloaded if they fail integrity checks.
If \code{FALSE}, all files are downloaded unconditionally.}

\item{...}{Reserved for future options.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{"rmet"} object with TD6401 files downloaded
  and \code{state$data$td6401} updated.
}
\description{
\code{downloadTD6401()} downloads NOAA TD6401 (ASOS 5-minute) surface
meteorological data files required by AERMINUTE.

The function verifies file integrity using lightweight checks
(existence, minimum file size, readability, station identifiers)
and re-downloads files that are missing or fail validation.

Validation failures are reported to the console with a short file
preview to aid debugging. If any file fails validation after download,
the function stops with an error.

Successful execution updates the project \code{state} to record
completion time and covered years.
}
\details{
TD6401 files are not fully QA'd by NOAA and may contain malformed
records. The validation performed here is intentionally conservative
and does not attempt to enforce strict formatting rules; detailed
cleaning is deferred to AERMINUTE.
